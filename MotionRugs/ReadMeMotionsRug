A motion rugs is a 2D representation of a 3D system. The two dimensions of the space are converted into a single
dimension using Hilbert curves.

The representation then shows :
- the 1D space on the y-axis
- the time on the x-axis

By changing the colors of the cases, different things may be shown, like the average speed on a road, the number of vehicles, etc.
