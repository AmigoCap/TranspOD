Dynamic visualisation consists in representing the time dimension with a video.

More information can be found in that type of visualisation than in static visualisation but the execution of the codes are longer and the visualisation heavier.

We made 2 types of dynamic visualisation :
    - a replay that plays the simulation and reprensents the position of each vehicule in the map at each instant.
    - a heat flow animation that is meant to give a global idea of the density of vehicules instead of the exact position that can be less explicit if the replay is fast.
