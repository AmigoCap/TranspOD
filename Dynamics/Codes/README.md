First, you have to execute the code saveInstants.py to create on your computer a text file named "Instants.txt" that contains all the data required by the other codes.

Then, you can execute "Replay.py" and "Meteo.py" that create respectively a replay of the simulation and a heat flow animation.

The execution is quite long and depends on your machine, the "estimated time" is based on the time needed to calculate the visualisation on a MacBook Pro of 2017.

We have not had results of the heat flow simulation because our machine were not powerfull enough.
