ODMaps are maps that represents the origins and destinations of the vehicules over the entire simulation.

It is a static visualisation, often an image, that sums up the simulation.

We explored 3 types of ODMaps : one with straight lines, one with circles and one that we called "intern maps".

The first two ones are both quite intuitive. We drew in the first one straight lines beetween the origin and the destinations. In the second we drew on the map blue circles for origins and red circles for destinations. The size of the circles is increasing with the number of vehicules that had the same origin or destination.

The last static visualisation is quite new and requires explanations to be read properly and efficiently. A descriptive ReadODMap.rtf was created to this end.
